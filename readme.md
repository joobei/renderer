# Toy renderer based on vulkan-tutorial.

## Build Instructions
### Linux/Macos
- cmake ../renderer
- Clone the repo (Duh!)
- Download and install VulkanSDK https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
- make a build directory alongside the source dir (recommended: build dir and renderer source dir should be under the same folder)
- make

### on Windows Visual studio 2019-2022
- open git repo folder from visual studio  with File --> Open Folder
- That should activate visual studio's built in cmake project generator
- (Visual Studio 2022) change to target view. You should now have your target that you can build.
